/* HW3
The purpose of this homework assignment is to make you understand classes, objects, methods, if statements, and
loops.

The structure and hypothetical circumstance of this assignment is as follows:
We need a password that has a speficic length, contains atleast two capital letters, two lowercase letters,
two symbols, and two digits. We need this because, hypothetically, a customer is hiring you to create a class
that can be utilized for severl clients of his.

The first object must be created for the first level clients. The password for such clients must be at least eight
characters in length and contain one capital letter, onw lowercase letter, one symbol, and one digit.

The first level should be created using a default constructor(Hint:this should be static).

The second object must be created for the second level clients. The password for such clients must be at least eight
characters in length and contain two capital letters, two lowercase letters, one symbol, and one digit.

The second level should be created using an overloaded constructor.
